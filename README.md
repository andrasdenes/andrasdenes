- 👋 Hi, I’m @andrasdenes
- 👀 I’m interested in 

      Well I'm interested in a lot of things, but recently I'm dipping my toes into 3 deeps seas.
         - Application development with Flutter and Dart  
         - Artificial Intelligence - different recognitions and machine learning with Python  
            > Currently I and a small team are working on building a startup based on machine-based language analysis
         - Web development with Django and Python
   
- 🌱 I’m currently learning  
   I'm an intern working for an international company. Here I study the forte of C#.

> 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...

Yeah, sorry I'm still doing that thing where I don't even have time to sleep properly.  
Hehe, I'm keeping myself busy, so I cannot currently collaborate on anything.  
No worries though, I love it. Have a wonderful day!
